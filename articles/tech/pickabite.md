snippet: "Taiwanese popcorn chicken is a delicious appetizer, snack, or even protein. Served as inexpensive street food at night markets in Taiwan, the crispy and savory delicacy is often served as a pricey appetizer in America. After purchasing overpriced Taiwanese popcorn chicken multiple times, I finally decided enough was enough and attempted to make my own. I cooked the NY Times recipe more than a handful of times and this was my experience."
