#### Intro
I had recently seen a Tiktok influencer rave about how much they preferred their electric stove over its gas counterpart. I didn't know too much about either, only that electric was better for the environment. I decided to do a little research to see what I could find and this is what I discovered.

#### Gas
Gas stoves are powered by natural gas. They are far cheaper to operate than electric while the stoves themselves are often similar in price to alternatives. They take less time to start cooking with as they don't need to warm up for as long and can adjust the temperature with ease. This allows for more control and flexibility when cooking. Gas stoves are also resistant to power outages and can use any type of cookware such as a wok.

On the other hand, gas stoves are extremely wasteful with the emitted gas. Part of using an open flame means most of the energy won't be directed at the pot but heat up the room instead and can lead to uneven cooking. Gas leaks can pollute the inside of homes and even become lethal. Gas being a finite resource means using a gas stove could eventually become more expensive than electric as gas prices increase. Needless to say, gas stoves are not environmentally conscious. Gas stoves are also much more difficult to clean.

#### Electric
Electric stoves transmit more energy to the pot than gas. They convert the heat from electric currents that are directed into an electric resistant metal coil and transmit that heat to the glass stovetop through infrared energy. In addition, electric stoves won't pollute the inside of homes. Often electric stoves come with easy-to-understand controls and their stoves can be the some of the cheapest options. They are also easy to clean. Electric stoves also heat pans more evenly as long as the size of the pan fits. 

Electric stoves struggle with heat control as they take a while to heat up and cool down. While an alternative is to heat multiple sections of the stovetop to different heats, this is an inconvenient solution. And although the upfront cost of an electric stove may be cheaper, the cost of fueling it is not cheaper than a gas stove. Electric stoves are also vulnerable to power outages and have a frail stovetop made of glass. They can also lead to uneven cooking if the pan is larger than the coil or the coil doesn't evenly heat up. This means they can also not accommodate all sizes of cookware such as a big pot.

#### Induction
Induction stoves are a type of electric stove but instead of using a metal coil, induction stoves primarily use a copper coil and heating occurs through electromagnetic radiation. Induction stoves share certain perks of the traditional electric stove, such as being friendly to the environment or being easy to clean, but it improves on many aspects. Unlike electric stoves, they can generate heat quickly and cool quickly allowing for heat control similar to that of a gas stove.  Since heat is sent directly to the pot or pan rather than the stovetop through induction heating, the stovetop does not need time to cool. In addition, most energy transmitted is sent to the pot and very little is lost to the environment. This results in cooler kitchens and less energy usage. Induction stoves are known to get hotter than even gas stoves and are found to be able to heat things up much faster.

Some drawbacks of the induction stove are they can get so hot that they are known to cause hot spots and damage to pots and pans especially if the pots and pans are bigger than the coil they are placed on. Induction stoves also cost much more than the traditional electric stove and require induction-compatible cookware. They also share the same glass stovetop as normal electric stoves meaning they are vulnerable to being shattered.

#### Verdict
I had grown up with a gas stove and had unknowingly used an electric stove during undergrad. The only one I had never experienced was an induction stove and to me, it seems almost like an upgrade to the traditional electric stove other than its cost. The most desired aspect of the gas stove for me is heat control. Compared to the gas stove, the induction stove not only possesses the same capability, but it can cook faster and with more heat. The way I see it is you are paying more for an induction stove to avoid polluted gas, more efficient usage of fuel, more evenly heated food, and cooler kitchens. If I were to pick out a stove right now, I would go with an induction stove.
