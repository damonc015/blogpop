### Overview
 Cucumber salad is a versatile appetizer that can be prepared any number of ways. Asian cucumber salad is often made with soy sauce and seasame oil. However, even an Asian cucumber salad has many variations in spice, cut, and overall preparation. Attempting numerous versions of the Asian cucumber salad, I finally settled on my personal favorite recipe.

### Ingredients
- 1 cucumber
- 1 green onion
- 1 minced clove of garlic
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 tbsp vinegar
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp sesame seeds
- 1/2 tsp salt
- optional sesame oil

### My Experience
The recipe I used was from the Youtube channel Palden's Kitchen. Like many other recipes I had tried before it, this recipe prepares the cucumbers by peeling part of the cucumber skin and cutting it into pieces. Personally, I found that I enjoyed the texture of the skin and left it on. I had found some recipes excluded smacking the cucumber with the flat side of your cleaver. This is suppose to help your cucumbers absorb the flavors later; so I decided why not give it a few smacks. I preferred how this recipe did not cut the cucumber into slices but rather into chunks. I enjoyed eating the chunks more so than the slices as the pieces were thicker and juicier than their counterparts (and also much easier to slice evenly).

Cucumbers are naturally full of water so it is important to salt them and let them sit for a few minutes otherwise the water content will distill the added flavors. Compared to other recipes, this recipe only has them sit for ten minutes but I found there still to be a lot of water. I added a full teaspoon of salt rather than a half and had them sit for half an hour. 

The absolute pinnacle of this recipe is how the rest of the ingredients are prepared. In other recipes, green onions are not always included and the garlic is almost always added raw. This recipe has vegetable oil brought to a boil and then poured out onto the bowl of garlic, sesame seeds, chili flakes, and green onions. This cooks all four components and brings out more flavor and aroma. The soy sauce and vinegar are then poured in once the mixture has finished cooking. While the sesame oil is drizzled at the end as a top off, I added a tbsp of sesame oil to the mixture. In other recipes, sesame oil was a major ingredient and I adapted that here. 

And that's it! I refrigerate the cucumbers for atleast 30 min before serving as I do think they taste better cold but it is all personal preference!
