### Overview

Taiwanese popcorn chicken is a delicious appetizer, snack, or even protein. Served as inexpensive street food at night markets in Taiwan, the crispy and savory delicacy is often served as a pricey appetizer in America. After purchasing overpriced Taiwanese popcorn chicken multiple times, I finally decided enough was enough and attempted to make my own. I cooked the NY Times recipe more than a handful of times and this was my experience.

### Ingredients
- 2 lbs boneless chicken thighs or breast
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 3 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp Chinese five-spice powder
- 2 tbsp pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- vegetable oil
- cornstarch
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp basil leaves
- a sprinkle of garlic powder
- 1 tsp of chili powder

### My Experience
Although the recipe uses chicken thigh, the first few times I cooked this recipe I used chicken breast instead of thigh. Chicken breast is leaner as it is white meat while thigh is juicier as it is dark meat. I prefer using breast as I can buy more for the same price I purchased the thighs for and I hardly noticed a difference when eating the thighs. 

Dry and cut your choice of thigh or breast into bite-size pieces before marinating them with soy sauce, Chinese five-spice powder, and salt for 30 min. The recipe uses 4 tsp of salt but that is beyond excessive. The first time I used that much salt, the entire dish only tasted like salt so I am presuming it was a mistake on the original recipe. Even half that amount of salt was too much, so I used 1 1/2 tsp as opposed to 4. 

As the chicken finishes marinating, fill up a pot with vegetable oil deep enough to cover the chicken pieces and heat the oil to 350 degrees. When the chicken is done marinating coat them in cornstarch before putting them in the oil for 5 min. (In one attempt at this recipe, I tried coating the chicken in egg yolk to allow the cornstarch to stick better but found that the texture of Taiwanese popcorn chicken needs the cornstarch to only stick on parts of the chicken. If the cornstarch stuck on the entirety of the chicken, rather than getting bubbles of fried batter, the chicken would just have large clumps of fried batter.) Let the chicken rest for 2-3 minutes before putting them back in the oil. This second fry ensures a crispier finish as I had learned from a different recipe. 

The original recipe tops off the chicken with pepper and salt but I did not add any more salt. Instead, I added some pepper, squeezed lemon juice onto them, and topped them off with basil, garlic powder, and chili powder. I found that using just pepper and salt was a little bland. Adding the lemon juice, garlic powder, and chili powder gave it some zest and spice. The basil was used as garnish but also bolsters digestion. You can eat it as is but I sometimes lightly dip them in spicy mayo. Aside from a few changes, this recipe lays the foundation for making some amazing Taiwanese popcorn chicken and I don't see myself purchasing them outside again.
