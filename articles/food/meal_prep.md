#### Overview
 
 Getting into meal prep can be a daunting task given the various options. It becomes a struggle of balancing nutritional value and the price of ingredients, cooking time, and making sure it is flavorful enough to eat for a week straight. I normally bake a pack of chicken breasts and combine it with a bowl of rice and vegetables. While this was inexpensive and only took 40 minutes, I wanted to up my meal prep game and have it be less bland and add ingredients to make my prep even more nutritious. That is when I stumbled upon Joseph Abell's meal prep recipe. It guaranteed feeling energized by the nutrients it provided, so I decided to give it a go.

#### Ingredients
- 4 lbs chicken breast (optional)
- 4 sweet potatos
- 1 lb of brocolli
- 1 lb of cauliflower
- 1 lb of brussel sprouts
- 3-4 bell peppers
- 2 cups of quinoa
- any cooking oil
- optional salt, pepper, paprika, basil 

#### The Process
Start off by cooking the quinoa so it can cook while you prepare everything else. Put the quinoa in a rice cooker and cook with the mixed rice setting. Then wash the potatos, brocolli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, bell peppers before dicing them all into bite size pieces. Put them all in a bowl and season with salt, pepper, paprika, and basil. I added basil to the recipe as its consumption is suppose to bolster digestion.

Now the recipe does not require a meat protein but I added my baked chicken breast. Cut the chicken breast in half horizontally if they are more than 8 oz to make them thinner and easier to cook. Then dry the chicken breast and cover it with salt, paprika, and pepper. Followed by rubbing it with some vegetable oil and popping them in the oven for 25 min at 400 degrees. Lay the vegetables on a baking tray so you can simultaneously cook the diced vegetables with the chicken. The vegetables only need to be cooked for around 10 min so don't forget to remove them from the oven before they burn.

At this point it's just a waiting game which is great as it frees up time to do other things. 10 min in pull the vegetables out, 25 min in pull the chicken out, and 1 hr in stir the quinoa to break it apart and pack the ingredients into containers and refrigerate for the week. With about 12 oz a meal it will, at the very least, last 5 meals. 

Although the chicken breast will definitely be juicy, I usually add a barbeque or hot sauce when it comes time to eat the meal. 

#### Verdict
With the supplement of Joseph's recipe, I am definitely an advocate of its revitalizing nutritional value. After eating a meal, it feels as if I have a ton of energy to get through my day. If I could change something about this recipe it would be the quinoa, as it was way more expensive than normal rice. But the total costs of this prep comes under 30 dollars for five meals and it took less than an hr and a half to make. This makes it hard not to remake it!
