#### Overview

As I was grocery shopping the other day, I wanted to try to make a dish using an ingredient I haven't used before. Low and behold I stumbled upon tofu which was extremely cheap. I wanted to create something without the help of a recipe this time and settled on baking the tofu and creating a thick, spicy, and umami sauce to glaze them.

#### Ingredients

- 1 package of firm tofu
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 3 tsp sugar 
- cornstarch
- chili oil
- 2 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp red chili flakes
- 1 tbsp siracha
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp sesame seeds
- 1/2 tsp salt

#### The Process

I wanted the tofu to be slightly crisp and in order to do that I knew the firmer the tofu the better. Drain your package of tofu when first opening and proceed to dice the chunk into bite sized pieces. 

Cucumbers are naturally full of water so it is important to salt them and let them sit for a few minutes otherwise the water content will distill the added flavors. Compared to other recipes, this recipe only has them sit for ten minutes but I found there still to be a lot of water. I added a full teaspoon of salt rather than a half and had them sit for half an hour.

The absolute pinnacle of this recipe is how the rest of the ingredients are prepared. In other recipes, green onions are not always included and the garlic is almost always added raw. This recipe has vegetable oil brought to a boil and then poured out onto the bowl of garlic, sesame seeds, chili flakes, and green onions. This cooks all four components and brings out more flavor and aroma. The soy sauce and vinegar are then poured in once the mixture has finished cooking. While the sesame oil is drizzled at the end as a top-off, I added a tbsp of sesame oil to the mixture. In other recipes, sesame oil was a major ingredient and I adapted that here.

And that's it! I refrigerate the cucumbers for at least 30 min before serving as I do think they taste better cold but it is all personal preference!
