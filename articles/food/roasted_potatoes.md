#### Overview

Recently I decided to make a juicy medium-rare steak and what better to go with the meat than a side of roasted potatoes. Simple, quick, and cost-effective, roasted potatoes are a staple side dish for any steak. I used Delish's recipe for rosemary roasted potatoes but felt it was missing a step or two. This is my take on rosemary roasted potatoes.

#### Ingredients

- 4 russet potatoes
- 3 stalks of rosemary
- 3 stalks of thyme
- 3 minced cloves of garlic
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1 tbsp butter
- olive oil

#### My Experience

Start by preparing an ice bath for the potatoes. Wash and dice the potatoes before putting them into the bath. The recipe used baby potatoes but I went with russet potatoes so I could dice them into bite-size chunks as opposed to eating the baby potato sliced in half. I was not sure if baby potatoes needed to be soaked but for normal potatoes bathing them in ice water for 25-30 min removes a lot of extra starch on the potatoes allowing them to be crisper when baked. I decided not to skin the potatoes because the skin can get nice and crunchy when baked. After the bath, remove the diced potatoes and pat them dry so any seasoning sticks on better and so they will crisp when cooked.

As I stated, I was making a steak alongside these potatoes and had bought rosemary and thyme for the meat. While the recipe only used rosemary I added thyme as well for more aromatics and flavor. Wash the rosemary and thyme and tug off the leaves before mincing them. Putting your dried diced potatoes in a bowl, add the rosemary and thyme, as well as the minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and as much olive oil as you want on your potatoes. Put the potatoes on a baking tray and cook for 35-40 min. at 400 degrees. Depending on the desired texture of your potatoes, you can cook them for longer or shorter.

After taking the potatoes out of the oven, I melted about a tablespoon of butter in a bowl in the microwave and drizzled it on top of the potatoes before serving. And that's all!
